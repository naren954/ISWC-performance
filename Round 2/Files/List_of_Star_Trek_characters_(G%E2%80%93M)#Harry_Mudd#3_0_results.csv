List_of_Star_Trek_characters_(G%E2%80%93M)#Harry_Mudd#3_0,0,13,"Klingon captain of the IKS Pagh in 2365. He was short, heavyset, and demanded strict adherence to his authority. When he learned of the space organism eating away at a small section of the Pagh's hull, and that the Enterprise-D had directed an intense scanning beam at that specific area for two minutes, Kargan believed the Federation starship had landed a first strike against his vessel, so he vowed to attack and destroy the Enterprise-D. He suspected that Commander William Riker, his acting first officer, was complicit in the Enterprise-D's attack, so, to test his loyalty, Kargan demanded to know the surest method of attack against the Federation starship. When Riker refused to break his oath to Starfleet, Kargan relented, knowing at least that Riker wasn't a traitor or a coward. When Riker activated an emergency transponder given to him by Worf, Kargan, believing it was a weapon, demanded that Riker give it to him. Kargan was then beamed aboard the Enterprise-D, and Riker was able to assume command of the Pagh and defuse the brewing battle. Later, when Kargan was returned to the Pagh, Riker refused to resume his station, so Kargan slugged him and ordered him removed from the ship. That action allowed Kargan to save face and regain honor in the eyes of his officers, and likely averted an assassination attempt by Lieutenant Klag.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professional_wrestling_attacks
