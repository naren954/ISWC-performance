"4","4","Aeroflot Flight 217 crashed 1 km short of the runway during the third attempt to land at night in poor weather. The cause was not determined. The Sheremetyevo airport ILS system was inoperative at the time of the accident.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeroflot_Flight_217"
"4","5","Ä\u008CSA Flight 540 experienced a controlled flight into terrain at midnight some 17 km (11 mi) from the airport. The crew appeared possibly confused the QNH and QFE altimeter settings due to language misunderstanding with the control tower.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/China","http://dbpedia.org/resource/ČSA_Flight_540"

"4","7","LOT Flight 7 crashed due to a loss of control caused by uncontained failure of engine #2 which occurred after full thrust was applied during a missed approach from New York to Warsaw. Engine debris penetrated the fuselage causing damage to engine #1 & #3, and severed control rods for the rudder and elevators. The failed engine had reportedly caused vibrational problems when previously installed in two other LOT aircraft, and the turbine disc may have been already damaged when the engine was fitted. See discussion in Development section.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professional_wrestling_match_types","http://dbpedia.org/resource/LOT_Polish_Airlines_Flight_007 http://dbpedia.org/resource/LOT_Flight_7 http://dbpedia.org/resource/LOT_Flight_007"
"4","8","Aeroflot Flight 411 stalled and crashed after the pilot shut down both left side engines due to fire warnings. The unbalanced aircraft became difficult to control and crashed. Investigations later showed that the warning lights had been a false alarm, possibly caused by a hot-air bleed leak.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_travel_disruption_after_the_2010_Eyjafjallajökull_eruption","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeroflot_Flight_411"
"4","11","LOT Flight 5055 crashed following an uncontained engine failure and resultant in-flight fire. Engine #2 exploded during initial climb 25 minutes after takeoff, causing damage to engine #1 and a fire in the cargo hold. Landing at Gdansk or Modlin airfields were abandoned in favour of Warsaw (which had better fire-fighting equipment). The crew dumped half the fuel but control was lost during the return flight and the aircraft crashed. The #2 engine turbine shaft bearings had been improperly manufactured with 13 rollers instead of 26, causing overheating and seizure, destroying the shaft. The low-pressure turbine spun out of control and disintegrated. The crash was the worst involving an Il-62. See discussion under 'Development' section.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_II","http://dbpedia.org/resource/LOT_Polish_Airlines_Flight_5055 http://dbpedia.org/resource/LOT_Flight_5055"
"4","13","Cubana de AviaciÃ³n Flight 9646 crashed on climbout in bad weather. The crew attempted takeoff in heavy rain and wind by reducing the aileron settings from 30Â° to 15Â°, but this reduced the ability of the aircraft to gain altitude. Shortly after takeoff and while still at low altitude, the plane was caught in powerful downdrafts that forced one of the wings to strike navigational aerials and then a hillside before the plane crashed into a residential area.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cubana_de_Aviación_Flight_9646"
