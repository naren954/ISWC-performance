Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a controlled-descent test of the discarded booster vehicle. In the event, the first stage successfully decelerated from hypersonic velocity in the upper atmosphere, made a successful reentry, landing burn, deployment of its landing legs and touched down on the ocean surface.
